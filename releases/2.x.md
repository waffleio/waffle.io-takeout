## Waffle Takeout 2.2.0
_Released 2016.02.12_

#### New Features
- Simplified certificate configuration in the Waffle Takeout admin settings. Now, we rely on the console hostname and certificate settings, configured via the gear in the top right and "Console Settings" menu item. **This is a minor version update because users in some cases may have to reconfigure Takeout to make sure the console hostname is correct.**
- redirect port 80 to 443, so you don't have to worry about users not typing `https` in the url.
- Better installation progress reporting. Now the admin console will report errors during startup if we detect something is misconfigured.

## Waffle Takeout 2.0.0
_Released 2015.12.09_

_Supported GH:E versions: GH:E 2.2+_

#### New Features
- The 2.0 release train is delivered via [Replicated](../doc/REPLICATED.md). If you're on a 1.x version or earlier that was self-installed with docker images, we'll support upgrading to 2.0 soon. Replicated currently requires an internet connection during installation and upgrades. Updates to the 1.x train will continue until the upgrade path from 1.x is supported, and until Replicated supports installation without an internet connection.
- Choose owner when creating cards

#### Bug Fixes
- Support reconfiguring takeout configuration without resetting database
  - When changing the GH:E url, oauth token & secret, or adding GitHub.com support after configuring the first time, Takeout wouldn't pick up on the change unless you reset your database (awesome). This is fixed.
