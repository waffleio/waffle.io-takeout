# Installing Waffle Takeout

Go to [https://takeout.waffle.io](https://takeout.waffle.io) for more information on pricing and to sign up for a free 45 day trial.

Getting Started guides and other Waffle.io documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/wiki).

# Prerequisites

* A supported Linux server (modern versions of Ubuntu, Debian, CentOS, Red Hat & Fedora)
* A Waffle Takeout license file (downloadable from [https://takeout.waffle.io](https://takeout.waffle.io))
* A GitHub Enterprise installation secured via SSL certificate. (Waffle Takeout does not support connecting to GitHub Enterprise insecurely over HTTP at this time.)

## Host Machine

The standard setup consists of one host.

If you are using EC2, we recommend the m4.large instance type with at least a 32GB EBS volume.

For other setups we recommend hosts with 8 gigs of RAM and 2 CPUs.

## Network Configuration

To run Waffle Takeout, you will need to ensure the following ports are open:

| Port          | Service       | Description                                                                      |
| :------------ |:--------------| :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 8800          | Custom TCP    | This port is to access the admin dashboard for your Waffle Takeout installation  |
| 9880          | Custom TCP    | This port is for replicated host api to update the admin dashboard's status      |
| 443           | HTTPS         | Web application over HTTPS access                                                |
| 80            | HTTP          | Web application access                                                           |
| 22            | SSH           | SSH access                                                                       |

## Register a GitHub.com OAuth app

Waffle Takeout talks to GitHub Enterprise and GitHub.com via OAuth. You will need to create an OAuth application on your GitHub Enterprise installation or GitHub.com that Waffle Takeout can connect to.

#### For GitHub Enterprise

To register an OAuth application, first click on your profile icon. From there, navigate to Settings->Applications and to the Developer Applications tab. Select 'Register New Application.'

Make sure the Homepage URL and Authorization Callback match the URL for your Waffle Takeout installation: `https://waffle.company.com` (just the base url for where it's installed, no special path required).

When configuring your GitHub Enterprise url on the admin settings page, make sure to include the protocol ("https://") in the url.

## Installation

#### 1. SSH into your Linux server
#### 2. Run the following script:

 ```curl
$ curl -sSL https://get.replicated.com | sudo sh
 ```

#### 3. Access your server via HTTPS on port 8800 & bypass the SSL security warning.

## Maintenance

### Backups

Waffle Takeout automatically takes snapshots of the application state and database every 24 hours. These snapshots can be used to restore your Takeout installation in the event that something happens to the host machine or the installation itself. Snapshots are stored in `/var/lib/replicated/snapshots` on the host machine. It is highly recommended that you copy these backups to another location each day so that you are not at risk of losing them along with your installation in the event the host machine encounters complications.

### Updating your Waffle Takeout Installation

Update the Replicated agent on the host machine before upgrading the Waffle Takeout application. This is not always required, and the UI will prompt you to do so if it is required:

```curl
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install replicated replicated-ui replicated-agent replicated-updater
```

You can check for new app releases by going to the management interface dashboard `https://waffle.company.com:8800` and clicking on the 'Check Now' button. If an update is available you will be able to read the release notes and install the update.

## Migrating from 1.x (self-install) to 2.x (Replicated install)

If you installed Waffle Takeout by downloading a set of docker images and then manually running an installation script to configure Waffle Takeout, you'll need to migrate to our new installation method.

Upgrading to the 2.x release only requires configuring the new installation with your existing database encryption keys. Follow the normal installation steps above, and then check the optional "Migrate" checkbox. Provide the "Encryption Key" and "Signing Key" from your existing installation. These are found in your `/etc/waffle/environment.list` file on your host machine.
